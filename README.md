This package exposes a `<Modal />` component which is fully controlled by a single prop. It comes packed with enter and exit animations for all your motion needs.

It's currently powered by [react-transition-group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) but I'm planning to turn it into a zero-dependency package in the near future so that it doesn't hurt your [bundle size](https://bundlephobia.com/package/react-lean-modal).
